Hash-AutoHash-Record

This is a subclass of Hash::AutoHash designed to represent records
parsed from flat files.  The fields of the records can be
single-valued, multi-valued, or a collection of attribute-value pairs
which, in turn, can allow single or multiple values per attribute. A
field can also be any Hash::AutoHash object, including a
Hash::AutoHash::Record object, which makes it possible to represent
nested record structures.
